# Would You Rather Project

This is my implementation for an assessment project for Udacity's React course.
The project is a simple implementation of [Would You Rather game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Would_you_rather).

To interact with/play the game user should login using a list that contains a pre-created users and then he will be able to answer questions or add a new ones and also check the leaderboard or even logout and sign-in with the same user or a different one.

## Notes

The project is meant to be a demonstration/practice/application for the usage of the Redux, ReactRouter, and MUI libraries within a React application; thus, reloading the page will lead to loss of all the progress (newly added anwers or questions) as the app fakes the connection to a backend/database to store answers or to add new questions.

## Usage
