# Would You Rather Project

This is my impelementation for an assessment project for Udacity's React course.
The project is a simple impelmentation of [Would You Rather game] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Would_you_rather).

To interact with/play the game user should login using a list that contains a pre-creadted users and then he will be able to answer questions or add a new ones and also check the leaderboard or even logout and sign-in with same or different user.

## Notes

The project was meant to be a demonestration/practice/application for the usage of the Redux liberary whithin a React application and thus, reloading the page will lead to loss of all the progress (newly added anwers or questions) as the app fakes the connection to a backend/database to store answers or to add new questions.

## Usage

Install dependencies via npm:
`npm install`
and then app can be served on Localhost which can be done via npm script:
`npm start`
